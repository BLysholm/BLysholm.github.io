                <h1>Brandon Lysholm's Portfolio</h1>
                <p>I am passionate about tech and theology, and want to merge those two together. I studied at Ambrose University and got a Bachelor of Theology in Church Ministry. 
                I also attended Sask Polytech and got a Computer Systems Technology diploma. I have also volunteered and worked for churches in their tech ministries. With these vaired experiences
                I am well suited for serving in a church as a tech director <br/>
				For the past five years, I have started feeling the call towards serving in a church in a tech role. So, for the past five years I have been continuously refining the various tech 
				skills needed to cover all the tech needs that a church would look for.</p>
