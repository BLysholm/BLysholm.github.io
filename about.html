				<p>
					I grew up in various towns in western Canada. When I was in high school, my family lived in northern BC. After graduating high school in 2015, I worked full-time for a year before attending
					Ambrose University starting in the fall of 2016. <br /><br />
					
					At Ambrose, I went through their School of Ministry programming, graduating with a Bachelor of Theology in Church Ministry, with a minor in Psychology and a second minor in Sociology. Attending Ambrose is
					when my interest in theology really developed. I deeply enjoyed the biblical studies classes, as well as gaining an understanding that their can be multiple approaches to theological issues that are 
					biblically supported. I also started getting involved in tech at my church during my third year. As they were short soundtechs, I got a lot of practice in a short time period, and learned a lot. In my
					fourth year, I took the position of Chapel Tech Coordinator for Ambrose, which involved overseeing both sound techs and ProPresenter techs. In previous years, the Tech Coordinator would do more of the tech
					themselves, but I wanted to build a team to cover the positions needed. I started the year with one ProPresenter tech, who wanted to achieve the same thing of building a team. He was passionate and competent,
					so I let him manage the ProPresenter team which he built up to include three more techs by the end of the year. On the audio side, I recruited and trained three more techs to volunteer. Building up this volunteer
					team was the highlight of this position for me. <br /><br />
					
					After my fourth year, I moved to Saskatoon in the Spring of 2020 to do my internship at Westgate Alliance Church. Since it was during COVID, my role ended up being more tech oriented than initially planned. through
					my internship, I felt my calling to ministry be refined into more of a Tech Director role. I saw during COVID how theological decisions were having to be made from the tech booth, as well as a growing need for tech
					within the church. Therefore, when I graduated from Ambrose in 2021, I applied to take the Computer Systems Technology program from Sask Polytech. This is a two year certificate program that covers systems administration,
					network administration, and various programming disciplines. I started this program in Fall 2022, and finished it in Spring 2024. During this same time period, I worked at Circle Drive Alliance Church part-time as their
					Technical Production Manager. This role at Circle involved overseeing all their tech needs on Sunday mornings for their in-person service and the livestream. During this time, managed a volunteer team of about twenty people
					and implemented improvements and repairs on their technical equipment. <br /><br />
					
					On the personal side, I met my now wife, Jessie at Ambrose. We dated throughout our degrees, and got married in July 2021. I have a variety of interests, one of which is building/DIY projects. Some examples of DIY projects
					I have enjoyed is building a custom computer desk, as well as creating a cable tester to start learning simple electronics. I have a few more DIY projects currently in the planning stage as well. Another interest is Jessie and
					I enjoy playing board games. I have also been physically active, with competitively running in highschool and a bit during university, longboarding, and in the past few years started commuting by bicycle year round (even in the
					Saskatoon winters).
