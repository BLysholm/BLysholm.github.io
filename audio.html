					<h3>Live Audio</h3>
					<p>
						Mixing audio for onsite worship is how I got started volunteering in the tech booth years ago. I have mixed audio for various churches of different sizes. 
						The opportunity of working in a variety of churches have given me the opportunity to learn mixing on different soundboards and with different styles of 
						worship. <br />
						I am most familiar with Yamaha digital mixers, but have also worked on Allen & Heath and Presonus digital mixers. I have also done some work on analog mixers.
						For monitor mixing, I have experience with both wedge monitors and IEMs. With IEMs, I have mixed monitors for musicians as well as used Aviom Personal Mixer system.<br />
						When I was the Chapel Tech Coordinator at Ambrose University, we had to setup the stage from scratch for every chapel. This got me familiar with doing frequent stage strikes
						and how to wire a full system.

					<h3>Online Audio</h3>
					<p>
						When I first started doing online audio in 2020, we were using an aux send on the soundboard to allow a partially independent mix for livestream. This was done due to not having
						enough volunteers to create a fully dedicated position for online audio. Having the aux send be post-fader, one sound tech could easily adjust two mixes at once as the song required. <br />
						When I started working at Circle Drive Alliance Church, they were using Dante to provide multitrack audio, and had a separate audio tech mix online audio via Reaper. This gave me the Experience
						of mixing audio with a DAW. When I started, they did not have anyone involved with extensive audio experience, so I was able to provide my insights from mixing live audio to help them better
						understand how to mix audio.

					<h3>Training Volunteers</h3>
					<p>
						I have had the opprotunity to train several new soundtechs. This helped give me the skill of training new techs, and helped me articulate my knowledge of audio better. It also helped me understand
						that having more objective guidelines for audio is necessary. While I prefer judging the volume of a mix via the subjective feeling of loudness, I learned that having objective guidelines can be
						beneficial in training and helping achieve consistency between sound techs. <br />
						When I started working at Circle Drive Alliance Church, I had to learn how to help develop already trained sound techs, and how to lead a pre-existing volunteer team. My previous experience leading
						a tech team was at Ambrose, with a team I built/recruited. This led to me learning how to evaluate sound techs, so that I can figure out how best to support them and what additional training they
						would need if any.

					<h3>Theology</h3>
					<p>
						A unique perspective I can provide is theological reflections on the message the tech communicates to the congregation. How we mix audio communicates what the values of the church is and their
						theology of worship. This is where my Bachelors of Theology from Ambrose can be beneficial. It allows me to think more critically on what the tech booth does during services, so that instead of
						providing the most technologically sound concert, we provide a meaningful worship experience for the congregation. A simple example of this would be the volume of which we mix the worship. If we
						mix it too loud, it drowns out the congregations voices, communicating the idea that worship is a passive act to be consumed. Whereas getting the balance right, enables the room full of voices to be
						heard, communicating the communal aspect of worship.
