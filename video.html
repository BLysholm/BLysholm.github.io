					<h1>Video Experience</h1>
					<p>
						My video experience has been refined through doing some prerecorded and livestream work at Westgate Alliance Church. When I was doing my internship there, I did video recording and
						editing their online content. I also was heavily involved in setting up their video streaming setup and was one of the primary video switchers for over a year. This also involved
						controlling PTZ cameras, which helped me refine my skills in framing shots. <br /><br />
						For the past few years, I have been overseeing, but not directly doing the video component of our livestream. I had a competent team, and more 
						pressing issues so I was not highly involved in giving direction in this area. Sadly, that means that I do not have video experience to display in my portfolio. <br /><br />
						When I got hired at Circle Drive Alliance Church, the video portion of the livestream was going well. However, the audio both onsite and online needed attention. So, I let the Video
						team continue and be self-sufficient, while I addressed other problems. I did occassionally operate a camera, but it was not my primary focus. During my time at Circle, wear and tear 
						on the video equipment was starting to occur so I started training camera operators on troubleshooting their equipment. <br /><br />
						The camera gear that I have experience with is:
						<ul>
							<li>Blackmagic Ursa Mini G2 Cinema Camera</li>
							<li>Blackmagic Pocket Cinema 6K Pro</li>
							<li>Cannon DSLRs</li>
							<li>Nikon DSLRs</li>
						</ul>
