					<h3>Web Development</h3>
					<p>
						One of the focuses of my classes at Sask Polytech was on web development. I received formal training on how to create websites 
						and	web applications. I also learned development frameworks can make development time quicker. An example of my
						skills is this website was one that I coded myself, not using a website builder. I also have experience
						maintaining a church website, as that was one of my roles at Westgate Alliance Church.

					<h3>System/Network Administration</h3>
					<p>
						I have formal training in how to manage networks and computers. This is useful in church A/V settings as tech booths
						are using more network controlled devices. To expand on this, I learned how computer networks work, an understanding of 
						network infrastructure, and specifics on IP addresses. Also, the computer management is useful in maintaining and troubleshooting
						computers within church tech booths and church offices. Part of the systems administration is I learned how to use Windows Server
						and AD DS to implement and centrally manage devices. This can make managing computers used throughout the church easier and more
						proactive.

					<h3>Mobile App Development</h3>
					<p>
						In my classes at Sask Polytech, I received formal training on how to develop both native and cross-platform applications for both
						Android and iOS. Before Sask Polytech, I also was the primary person involved in designing and deploying a mobile
						app for Westgate Alliance Church using an app building provider.

					<h3>Application Development Lifecycle</h3>
					<p>
						At Sask Polytech I did a year-long class that had us working with external clients to develop applications for their
						company to use. This was to give us experience in meeting with clients to gather requirements,, prioritize features,
						and developing an application. This could be beneficial in a church setting, as it could enable me to create small
						applications for church staff to help them complete administrative tasks. I am also formally trained to program in
						a variety of languages, including C, C#, Java, Javascript, Python, Swift, and HTML/CSS.
