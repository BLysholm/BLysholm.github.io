            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>
                At Sask Polytech, I received formal training on how to create websites and web applications. I also
                learned development
                frameworks that can make development more efficient. To demonstrate my skills in web development, I
                coded this website instead
                of using a website builder. I also have experience maintaining a church website, as that was one of my
                roles at Westgate Alliance Church.

            <h3>System/Network Administration</h3>
            <p>
                I have formal training in how to manage networks and computers. To expand on this, I learned how
                computer networks work, developed an
                understanding of network infrastructure, and learned specifics on IP addresses. This is useful in church
                A/V settings, as more devices
                being used in tech booths are being able to be controlled over a network connection. In addition to
                church tech booths, I can also support
                church ministries by maintaining and troubleshooting computers in church offices. For example, I can use
                Windows Server and Active Directory
                Domain Services, which is a Windows Server feature that allows for a server to centrally keep track of
                all computers and user accounts. With
                Active Directory Domain Services, accounts are stored centrally but can be used on multiple computers,
                making management easier. This makes
                it easier to manage computers throughout the church easier and to be more proactive in solving issues.

            <h3>Mobile App Development</h3>
            <p>
                At Sask Polytech, I received formal training in how to develop native and cross-platform applications
                for Android and iOS. Prior to this, I
                was the primary person involved in designing and deploying a mobile app for Westgate Alliance Church
                using a platform that provided easy
                tools to build mobile apps for churches.

            <h3>Application Development Lifecycle</h3>
            <p>
                At Sask Polytech, I participated in a year-long class in which we worked with external clients to
                develop applications for their company to use.
                I gained experience in working with a team, meeting with clients to gather requirements and prioritize
                features and developing an application.
                This could be beneficial in a church setting, as it gave me tools that I could use to create small
                applications for church staff to help them
                complete administrative tasks. I am also formally trained to program in a variety of languages,
                including C, C#, Java, JavaScript, Python,
                Swift, and HTML/CSS.
