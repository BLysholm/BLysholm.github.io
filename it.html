			<p>
				Through my Computer Systems Technology program at Sask Polytech, I learned a variety of IT skills. I learned a variety of languages and techniques for
				website development. Another skill I learned is systems administration. This would be beneficial in a church setting as I learned how to use tools for central management
				such as Microsoft AD DS. I also know how to do mobile app development, both in iOS and Android. Another skill is network administration. Network administration is useful to know
				in a church environment, as more of the equipment in tech booths are being configured via network connections. Therefore, with these skills I can benefit the church not just in the 
				tech booth on Sunday, but also act as the IT department for the staff during the week.
