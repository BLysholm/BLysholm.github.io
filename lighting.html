						This is first picture was taken during a practice during a Worship night at CDAC. This was my first attempt at creating
						a lighting environment from scratch. I was told that the room plan was the worship team in the middle in a circle facing
						inwards and the congregation surrounds them. I iterated on that idea by adding a cross in the center. Then, for lighting,
						my only source of white light was shining on the cross, and then I used coloured wash lights to bring up the ambient lighting.
						This created a theological message of the only source of light was the cross in the center, and those closer to the cross were
						brighter.

						After the first Worship night, I itterated on using the stained glass at the front of the room. So I setup a really bright light
						outside to backlight the stained glass as shown above. Then I set my room wash lights to a more orange tint to match the stained
						glass, and giving it a warm and cozy feel.

						On top of the more striped down worship nights, I have also experience using more complex lighting setups as done with our Sunday morning
						services at CDAC. THis has involved standard stage lighting, programming moving head lights, coloured LEDs, and training new lighting techs.

						Overall, in the past year, I have grown a higher appreciation of lighting. I have learned more on how lighting can be used to communicate
						theological messages and values in an easy to read format. It is not just something that can elevate the energy of worship, but also to communicate
						theological concepts, or to draw focus to certain elements.
